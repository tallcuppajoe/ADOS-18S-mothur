# MICRoN-16S-mothur
This repository includes the workflow for analysis of amplicons from the genes for the small subunit of ribosomes for prokaryotes (16S) and
eukaryotes (18S). Samples were amplified using the Earth Microbiome Project primers and sequenced at Argonne National Laboratory using
the Illumina MiSeq platform. Samples were taken from periphyton grown on plexiglass plates in streams for 14 days.
