# MICRoN-16S-mothur
This repository includes the workflow for analysis of amplicons from the genes for the small subunit of ribosomes for prokaryotes (16S) and
eukaryotes (18S). Samples were amplified using the Earth Microbiome Project primers and sequenced at Argonne National Laboratory using
the Illumina MiSeq platform. Samples were taken from periphyton grown on plexiglass plates in streams for 14 days.

While the workflows are currently commented on a bit, I intend to make them easier to read, as well as explain the steps better than they
are currently. Also, I want to add back into the workflow how the silva.v4 and silva.euk.v9 were generated. We won't want to do so every
time, but I feel that the workflow should include that step so others can reproduce our results.
